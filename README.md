Welcome to the RecyCraft, your ultimate gateway to efficient non-biodegradable waste management. Our vision extends beyond a simple app; we are creating a dynamic ecosystem that connects common people with waste vendors and recycling factories. Powered by OpenAI, our innovative waste management platform is designed to help you recycle responsibly and make a positive impact on the environment. Whether you're a concerned individual at home or part of a larger organization, the RecyCraft Ecosystem is here to simplify your waste disposal journey.

## Mobile and Web Solutions 📱💻

The RecyCraft Ecosystem is more than just an app; it's a comprehensive solution that caters to your waste management needs, wherever you are. We are committed to providing you with a seamless experience on both mobile and web platforms.

- **Mobile App:** We're in the process of developing a mobile app that will bring the power of the RecyCraft Ecosystem to your fingertips. Soon, you'll be able to manage waste and access recycling information on the go, making responsible recycling a part of your everyday life.

- **Web App:** Our web app offers a user-friendly interface that you can access from your computer or tablet. It's the perfect solution for when you need detailed recycling information, want to connect with recycling partners, or explore sustainable practices from the comfort of your desk.

## How it Works 🔄

The RecyCraft Ecosystem streamlines waste management with its user-friendly interface and cutting-edge features. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Keyword Recycling:** Start by entering a specific keyword related to your waste item, such as "plastic bottle," into the user-friendly interface. RecyCraft harnesses the power of AI to provide you with an extensive list of recycling options tailored to your query. But we don't stop there; we also connect you with local recycling facilities and vendors, ensuring you have all the information you need to recycle responsibly and sustainably.

2. **Image Recognition:** We're excited to introduce an image recognition feature. You'll be able to take a photo or upload an existing picture of your waste item directly into the RecyCraft Ecosystem. Our advanced AI model will swiftly identify the object and recommend optimal recycling methods. Keep an eye out for this upcoming enhancement, as it promises to make recycling even more accessible!

3. **Video Object Recognition (Future Enhancement):** Looking ahead, we have ambitious plans to introduce video object recognition. With this feature, you can upload a video containing one specific waste items, and the RecyCraft AI will meticulously analyze each frame, identify the object, and provide comprehensive recycling guidance. While this feature is currently in the pipeline, it has the potential to revolutionize waste management.
